# Opaque and Tranparent Models
## Opacity:
- *Using ML, some AI systems may discover novel correlations between certain input features (e.g., clinical symptoms) and accurate decision or prediction outputs (e.g., medical diagnoses) based on highly complex models that involve potentially millions of parameters that interact, making it hard even for AI experts to comprehend how their outputs are subsequently produced.*
## Transparency:
- *Enables accountability by allowing stakeholders to validate and audit its decision-making processes, detect biases or unfairness, and ensure that the system is operating in alignment with ethical standards and legal requirements.*
- *Refers to the ability for a specific model to be understood. In the strictest sense, a model is transparent if a person can contemplate the entire model at once.*
