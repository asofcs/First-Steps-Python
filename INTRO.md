# Opaque and Tranparent Models
## Opacity:
- *Using ML, some AI systems may discover novel correlations between certain input features (e.g., clinical symptoms) and accurate decision or prediction outputs (e.g., medical diagnoses) based on highly complex models that involve potentially millions of parameters that interact, making it hard even for AI experts to comprehend how their outputs are subsequently produced.*
## Transparency:
- *Enables accountability by allowing stakeholders to validate and audit its decision-making processes, detect biases or unfairness, and ensure that the system is operating in alignment with ethical standards and legal requirements.*
- *Refers to the ability for a specific model to be understood. In the strictest sense, a model is transparent if a person can contemplate the entire model at once.*

# Interpretability and Explainability
## Interpretability
- *Interpretability refers to the degree of human comprehensibility of a given black box model or decision*
- *Interpretable AI models allow humans to estimate what a model will predict given an input, and understand when the model has made a mistake.*
## Explainability
- *Explainability in AI concentrates on providing clear and coherent explanations for specific model predictions or decisions.*
- *Explainability is particularly important in critical applications where human lives or sensitive information are at stake, as it helps users, regulators, and stakeholders comprehend the rationale behind AI-generated outcomes.*
  
# White Box and Black Box
## White Box:
- *In white box models, the algorithms used are straightforward to understand and it is possible to interpret how the input features are transformed into the output or target variable. The most important features for predicting the target variable can be identified, and these features are understandable.*
- *Interpretability can be provided at different levels: for the whole model, for individual components (e.g., input parameters), or at the level of a particular training algorithm.*
- *Two examples of white box models are decision trees, and linear regression.*
## Black Box
- *Black box models are not explainable by themselves. The lack of explainability might result from an intentional obfuscation from the system designer, or from the complexity of the model.*
- *Certain types of AI present specific difficulties due to their inherent complexity and lack of interpretability.*
- *Examples of more complex architectures include neural networks, which consist of multiple layers of interconnected artificial neurons, with each layer performing computations and passing signals to the next layer.*
- *The post hoc approach therefore seems more appropriate for complex systems.*
